# [505 Emergency](https://github.com/BigOnake/505_Emergency) - Empowering Hope, Saving Lives
## Inspiration: 
Empowering Hope, Saving Lives: SOS Emergency,  we desired to assist those in dangerous situations with a safer way to contact help.

## What it does: 
 It is an interactive app that the user can use to 'check in' when in a situation where they may be in danger, notifying an emergency contact or the authorities if they do not keep checking in.

## How we built it: 
Using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), we made an Android and iOS mobile application with a button to press in an emergency.

## Challenges we ran into:
Since it's the first time for every one of us in Hackathon, we have challenges in Github, Flutter, UI/UX, and even in Terminal. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of: 
 We created the whole app that works with Flutter, mainly we worked as a 'team' which is the prior thing for us, as we were good at SDLC.

## What we learned: 
 We learned to work in teams using GitHub, and how not to use GitHub. We learned Flutter the most.

## What's next for 505 Emergency: 
 We wanted to add live location sharing along with sending an SMS option to the emergency contact and required authorities if needed.
